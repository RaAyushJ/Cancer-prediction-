#  Lung Cancer Risk Prediction using Ensemble Learning

This project uses machine learning to **predict the likelihood of lung cancer** in patients based on lifestyle and health features. Multiple models are trained and then combined into an **ensemble model** for improved performance.

##  Dataset

The dataset (`lung_cancer_examples.csv`) includes the following features for each patient:

| Feature     | Description                                |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Name        | Patient's first name (not used in model)   |
| Surname     | Patient's surname (not used in model)      |
| Age         | Age in years                               |
| Smokes      | Smoking frequency (approx. cigarettes/day) |
| AreaQ       | Air quality score in patient's area        |
| Alkhol      | Alcohol intake frequency                   |
| Result      | Target label: 1 = High Risk, 0 = Low Risk  |

Total records: **10 (sample dataset)**

##  Models Trained

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **XGBoost Classifier**

---

## Ensemble Learning

All three models were combined using a **soft voting ensemble classifier**, which takes the average of predicted probabilities and chooses the most confident class.

### Performance

| Model               | Accuracy |
|--------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression| ~xx%     |
| Random Forest      | ~xx%     |
| XGBoost            | ~xx%     |
| **Ensemble Model** | **xx%**  |

*(Exact scores depend on test split; sample size is small.)*

## How to Use the Model

1. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install scikit-learn xgboost joblib
